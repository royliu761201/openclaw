# MOST Grant Application Guidelines (National Key R&D / STI 2030)

## 1. Official Platform & Templates
**CRITICAL**: All applications must be submitted via the **National Science and Technology Management Information System** (https://service.most.gov.cn/).
- **Updates**: Some programs (e.g., HPC) have **removed the Pre-Application (预申报)** phase for 2024/2025, moving directly to Full Application.
- **Templates**: Available *only* after logging in to the system. Do not use offline drafts without verification.

## 2. Program Types
### A. National Key R&D Program (国家重点研发计划)
- **Focus**: Strategic, fundamental, and forward-looking major scientific issues.
- **2025 Themes**:
    - High Performance Computing (HPC)
    - Industrial Software
    - Mathematics and Applied Research
    - Advanced Materials, etc.
- **Process**:
    1.  **Unit Nomination**: Must be recommended by a qualified unit (Ministry, Province, Top Uni).
    2.  **Online Submission**: Via `service.most.gov.cn`.

### B. STI 2030 Major Projects (科技创新2030—重大项目)
- **Focus**: AI (Next Gen AI), Quantum, Brain Science.
- **Structure**: Project (项目) -> Topic (课题).
- **Format**:
    - **Draft**: Often requires a "Pre-Application" (3000 words) first, unless waived.
    - **Formal Application**: Detailed technical route, budget, and team structure.

## 3. Applicant Eligibility (Limit Rules)
- **Project Leader**: typically < 60 years old (Young Scientist projects < 35/40).
- **Limit (限项)**: Strict "2-Current-Projects" rule. If you strictly have 2 ongoing National projects (NSFC Major + Key R&D), you cannot apply.
- **Effort**: Leader must commit > 6 months/year.

## 4. Writing Focus
1.  **Performance Indicators (考核指标)**:
    - **MUST BE MEASURABLE**. "Third-party validation" is often required.
    - Example: "Accuracy > 95% on Dataset X", "Throughput > 10k TPS".
2.  **Technical Route**:
    - Needs clearly defined work packages (课题).
    - Integration plan for the deliverables.
3.  **Innovation**:
    - Contrast with international state-of-the-art (SOTA).

## 5. Agent Instructions
similar to NSFC, the `GrantWriter` interacts with the **Content generation**.
- **Constraint**: Strict word counts (3000 words for pre-app).
- **Output**: LaTeX/Markdown content.
- **Action**: User pastes content into the web form.
